          <h1>"The Guy"</h1>
          <p>
            The Guy is the mascot of Disturbed. He has appeared in several
            albums as the “cloaked character” on the cover art, and in music
            videos as the anti-hero that ends up defeating large corporations or
            armies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Anti-hero/revolutionary with edgy powers and is generally perceived
            as hyperactive and psychotic. The embodiment of the archangel the
            destroyer. He also seams to have dark magic around his face. At one
            point, he was considered/called a “spirit of vengeance”.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Guy has been featured as a fully animated character in the music
            video for Land of Confusion and has appeared on the covers of two of
            Disturbed's albums, Ten Thousand Fists and Indestructible. The Guy
            was originally just a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen
            on the back of the The Sickness album and later in the music video
            for "Stupify". After being just a drawing, The Guy has become the
            official mascot for the band, fully animated by Spawn creator Todd
            McFarlane. The Guy got his name from Mike Wengren's nephew, who used
            to be afraid of The Guy's face, saying "That's the guy! That's the
            guy, isn't it!"
