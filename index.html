<!--Purpose: To design, develop, and publish a web site on a topic of your choice using recommended design practices. Your web site will contain a home page and at least six (but no more than ten) content pages. You are required to create an external style sheet (.css file) that configures text, color, and page layout. (No font tags, embedded CSS, or inline CSS may be used.) 
Your site will be submitted via the Blackboard site. Required components of the pages include:

External hyperlinks
Consistent banner logo
Consistent main navigation - The site navigation should be the same on all site pages. A user must be able to navigate to the other major sections of the site with only one click.
Your site must utilize an external style sheet (.css file)

You will be free to determine the look and feel of your site (Color and Graphics). Extra credit will be given to students who creatively modify and create their own graphics and images.
Extra credit will be given to students who utilize Bootstrap in order to make their site fully responsive.

Your web site project will be evaluated on the following criteria: 

Including all required web page elements
Visual appeal of site to target audience
The Site Concept, Site Content, and Site Design must support each other. The overall concept, content, and design must make sense. A user should understand what your site is about as soon as they arrive. For example, if your site is about Major League Baseball, there should be pictures, text, and graphics about baseball throughout the site.
All site links must work. Significant reductions in grade will accompany any site in which the links do not work. If a link does not work it means that you did not test your site.
Accomplishment of project's objectives

Publish & Discuss Project: Upload your project to the Blackboard site. Be prepared to show your web site to the class, explaining the purpose behind each page / group of pages.-->

                Disturbed has been my favorite band since I was in Middle
                School. With their
                <span class="emphasis">adrenaline-rushing songs</span> and
                <span class="emphasis">thought-provoking lyrics</span>, it's no
                surprise that they are still a successful group to this day,
                recently releasing their newest album "Evolution" on October
                19th.
              </p>
              <p>
                This website is my developing shrine dedicated to all of their
                current and future accomplishments.
